# How to Run the App

cd pokemonchallenge

Once you're inside the project directory, install the necessary packages by typing:

npm install

After the installation is complete, start up the development server to run the React application:

npm start

Note: Not every Pok√©mon card from the API is fetched, so some sorter categories might be empty. However, all of them are functional.
